      <h2>What is PisCue?</h2>
      <p>
When science goes wrong… only one scholar can set it right.

Welcome to PisCue, a thrilling side-scrolling platform adventure set inside PSHS CLC. What started as a normal school day has turned into total academic chaos. The brilliant (but slightly unhinged) Chemistry teacher, Sir Rohit Tilwani, has kidnapped your beloved Physics teacher, Sir Jaypee Limueco, to prove once and for all that chemistry is the superior science!

Now it’s up to you to become the boldest scholar in school and rescue him.

      <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        PisCue was inspired by the classic Super Mario Bro's. We wanted to indulge our experiences in the very cute game itself.
